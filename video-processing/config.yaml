# Video Highlight Pipeline Configuration

# ==================================
# General & Main Script Settings
# ==================================
main:
  # The default prompt to use if one is not provided via environment variables.
  default_prompt: "<image> Is there a person in the air jumping into the water?"
  # The S3 prefix (folder) where the final highlight videos will be uploaded.
  s3_output_prefix: "results"

# ==================================
# Stage 1: Downsampling
# ==================================
downsampling:
  # The target frames-per-second to downsample the video to before inference.
  # A lower value (e.g., 2-4) significantly speeds up processing.
  target_fps: 4

# ==================================
# Stage 2: Inference
# ==================================
inference:
  # The model identifier from the Hugging Face Hub.
  model_id: "google/paligemma2-3b-mix-224"
  # Number of frames to process in a single batch. Adjust based on VRAM.
  batch_size: 16
  # Horizontal cropping start coordinate as a fraction of total width (0.0 to 1.0).
  crop_width_start: 0.0
  # Horizontal cropping end coordinate as a fraction of total width (0.0 to 1.0).
  crop_width_end: 1.0

# ==================================
# Stage 2.5: Post-Processing
# ==================================
post_processing:
  # The minimum confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) required to consider a "yes" prediction valid.
  confidence_threshold: 0.845
  # The maximum time in seconds to group nearby "yes" detections into a single event.
  grouping_threshold_sec: 2.5
  # Time in seconds to add to the beginning of a detected event to provide context.
  buffer_start_sec: 1.5
  # Time in seconds to add to the end of a detected event.
  buffer_end_sec: 3.0
  # The maximum gap in seconds between two event intervals before they are merged into one.
  merge_gap_sec: 3.5

# ==================================
# Stage 3: Clipping & Merging
# ==================================
clipping:
  # FFmpeg preset for encoding quality vs. speed trade-off.
  # Options: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow.
  ffmpeg_preset: "veryfast"
  # Constant Rate Factor (CRF). Lower values mean better quality and larger file size. (0-51).
  crf_value: 23
  # Audio bitrate for the final clips.
  audio_bitrate: "128k"
